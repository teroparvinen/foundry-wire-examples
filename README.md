# Example content for WIRE

This module contains content packs compatible with the [Whistler's Item Rolls Extended (WIRE)](https://github.com/teroparvinen/foundry-wire) module.

Content in these compendiums is provided as technical examples of how certain items supported by the dnd5e system can be implemented.

WIRE contains an import function for updating a non-WIRE character to adopt the items in these packs as well as for updating characters as new versions of
this module are released. See [using WIRE compatible compendiums](https://github.com/teroparvinen/foundry-wire/wiki/Using-WIRE-compatible-compendiums) in
the WIRE WIKI.

## Installation

This module is not available through the Foundry package system. You must install it manually using the manifest url in the bottom of the Foundry package 
installation screen. The manifest URL to use is (https://github.com/teroparvinen/foundry-wire-examples/releases/latest/download/module.json).

The items in this module do not contain any description text because that might be the property of a third party.

The character item import/upgrade wizard in WIRE will use the existing description of an item for the replacement version imported from a compatible
compendium in case the description on the compendium item is empty. If you already have an item on a character that matches the items in this module 
by name and you use the WIRE import functionality (through the plug icon at the top of the character sheet), any existing decription text will be copied
from the existing item and preserved.
